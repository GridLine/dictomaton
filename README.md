# fsadict-java

This Java package implements dictionaries that are stored in finite state automata.
Two types of dictionaries are supported:

 * Finite state dictionaries that can be checked for membership and iterated.
 * Perfect hash dictionaries, that also provide a unique hash for each character
   sequence that is in the dictionary.
